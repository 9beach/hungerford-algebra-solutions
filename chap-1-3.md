1\. Let $a$, $b$ be elements of a group $G$. Show that $|a| = |a^{−1}|$;
$|ab| = |ba|$, and $|a| = |cac^{−1}|$ for all $c∈G$.

**_Proof._**$\quad$By Theorem 2.8, the subgroup $\langle a \rangle$
generated by $a$ consists of all finite products $a^n(n \in \mathbb{Z})$;
thus $\langle a \rangle = \langle a^{-1} \rangle$, and so $|a| = |a^{−1}|$.
<br />$\quad$
Suppose that $ab$ has finite order $m$. Since
$$
e = (ab)^m = abab...ab = a(ba)^{m-1}b \iff
$$
$$
(ba)^{m-1} = a^{-1}e b^{-1} \iff (ba)^{m-1}b = a^{-1}
\iff (ba)^m = e,
$$
$|ba| \le |ab|$. Conversely, suppose that $ba$ has finite order. Similarly
to the previous, we have $|ab| \le |ba|$, and so $|ab| = |ba|$. Thus if one
of $|ab|$ and $|ba|$ is finite, then the other is finite; otherwise both
infinite, and by Theorem 3.2, every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to
the additive group $\mathbb{Z}$, so $|ab| = |ba| = \aleph_0$. Therefore,
$|ab| = |ba|$.
<br />$\quad$
By induction, $(cac^{-1})^m = cac^{-1}cac^{-1}...cac^{-1} = ca^mc^{-1}$
for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose that $cac^{-1}$ has finite order $m$.
Since
$$
e = ca^mc^{-1} \iff c e c^{-1} = e = a^m,
$$
$|a| \le |cac^{-1}|$. Conversely, suppose that $a$ has finite order $m$.
Since
$$
e = a^m \iff c^{-1}c = a^m \iff e = ca^mc^{-1},
$$
$|a| \ge |cac^{-1}|$, and so $|a| = |cac^{-1}|$. Thus if one of $|a|$ and
$|cac^{-1}|$ is finite, then the other is finite; otherwise both infinite,
and by Theorem 3.2, $|a| = |cac^{-1}| = \aleph_0$. Therefore, $|a| =
|cac^{-1}|.\quad\blacksquare$


2\. Let $G$ be an abelian group containing elements $a$ and $b$ of orders
$m$ and $n$ respectively. Show that $G$ contains an element whose order is
the least common multiple of $m$ and $n$. [_Hint:_ first try the case when
$(m, n) = 1$.]

**_Proof._**$\quad$
Write prime factorizations of $m$ and $n$ as
$$
m=\prod_{i}p_i^{\alpha_i} \text{ and } n=\prod_{i} p_i^{\beta_i},
$$
and let
$$
m’=\prod_{i: \alpha_i \geq \beta_i}p_i^{\alpha_i} \text{ and }
n’=\prod_{i: \beta_i> \alpha_i} p_i^{\beta_i} \text{ and } a’=a^{m/m’} \text{ and }  b’=b^{n/n’}.
$$
Note that $m'$ divides $m$, and $n'$ divides $n$, and $m'$ and $n'$ are
relatively prime, and $m'n'$ is the least common multiple of $m$ and $n$.
We claim that the order of $a'$ is $m'$. Let $k$ be the order of $a'$.
Since $e=(a')^k=(a^{m/m'})^k=a^{mk/m'}$, $m$ divides $mk/m'$, and so $m'$
divides $k$. On the other hand, since $(a^{m/m’})^{m’}=a^m=e$, $k$ divides
$m'$. So the order of $a'$ is $m'$. Similarly, the order of $b'$ is $n'$.
Now, let the order of $a'b' = r'$, we claim that $r'$ is $m'n'$. Since
$$
(a'b')^{m'n'} = a^{(m/m')m'n'}b^{(n/n')m'n'} = a^{mn'}b^{nm'} = e,
$$
$r'$ divides $m'n'$, and since
$$
e = (a'b')^{r'} = (a'b')^{r'm'} = a'^{r'm'}b'^{r'm'} = b'^{r'm'} = e,
$$
$n'$ divides $r'm'$. $m'$ and $n'$ are relatively prime, so $n'$
divides $r'$. Similarly, $m'$ divides $r'$; thus $m'n'$ divides $r$, and
so $r' = m'n'$. Therefore, $G$ contains an element whose order is the
least common multiple of $m$ and $n$.$\quad\blacksquare$

3\. Let $G$ be an abelian group of order $pq$, with $(p,q) = 1$. Assume there exists $a, b ∈ G$ such that $|a| = p, |b| = q$ and show that $G$ is cyclic.

4\. If $f : G → H$ is a homomorphism, $a ∈ G$, and $f(a)$ has finite order in $H$, then $|a|$ is infinite or $|f(a)|$ divides $|a|$.

5\. Let $G$ be a multiplicative group of all nonsingular $2 × 2$ matrices with rational  entries. Show that $a =
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & −1\\
  0 & \phantom{-}1
\end{pmatrix}$
has order $4$ and $b =
\begin{pmatrix}
  \phantom{-}0 & \phantom{-}1\\
  -1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}$
has order $3$, but $ab$ has infinite order. Conversely, show that the additive group $Z_2 ⊕ \mathbb{Z}$ contains nonzero elements $a, b$ of infinite order such that $a + b$ has finite order.

6\. If $G$ is a cyclic group of order $n$ and $k|n$, then $G$ has exactly one subgroup of order $k$.

7\. Let $p$ be prime and $H$ a subgroup of $Z(p^∞)$ (Exercise 1.10).<br />
$\quad$(a) Every element of $Z(p^∞)$ has finite order $p^n$ for some $n ≥
0$.
<br />$\quad$(b) If at least one element of $H$ has order $p^k$ and no
element of $H$ has order greater than $p^k$, then $H$ is the cyclic
subgroup generated by $\overline{1/p^k}$, whence $H \cong Z_{p^k}$.
<br />$\quad$(c\) If there is no upper bound on the orders of elements in
$H$, then $H = Z(p^∞)$; [see Exercise-I.2].
<br />$\quad$(d) The only proper subgroups of $Z(p^∞)$ are the finite
cyclic groups $C_n = ⟨\overline{1/p^n}⟩ (n = 1,2,...)$. Furthermore, $⟨0⟩
= C_0 ≤ C_1 ≤ C_2 ≤ C_3 ≤ ···$.
<br />$\quad$(e) Let $x_1,x_2,...$ be elements of an abelian group $G$
such that $|x_1| = p, px_2 = x_1, px_3 = x_2,...,px_{n+1} = x_n,....$ The
subgroup generated by the $x_i(i ≥ 1)$ is isomorphic to $Z(p^∞)$. [_Hint:_
Verify that the map induced by $x_i \mapsto  \overline{1/p^i}$ is a
well-defined isomorphism.]

8\. A group that has only a finite number of subgroups must be finite.

9\. If $G$ is an abelian group, then the set $T$ of all elements of $G$ with finite order is a subgroup of $G$. [Compare Exercise 5.]

10\. An infinite group is cyclic if and only if it is isomorphic to each of its proper subgroups.
