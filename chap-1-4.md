### 4. Cosets and Counting

**1.** Let $G$ be a group and $\{H_i\mid i\in I\}$ a family of subgroups. Then
for any $a\in G$, $(\bigcap_i H_i)a=\bigcap_i H_ia$.

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$Let $m\in(\bigcap_i H_i)a$. $m=ha$ for some
$h\in \bigcap_i H_i$, and so $ha\in\bigcap_i H_ia$. Conversely, let
$n\in\bigcap_i H_ia$. There is $h_i\in H_i$ such that $h_ia=m$ for all
$i\in I$. By the cancellation law for groups, $h_i$ is unique. Thus there is
a unique $h\in\bigcap_i H_i$ such that $ha=m$, and $ha\in(\bigcap_i H_i)a$.
Therefore, $(\bigcap_i H_i)a=\bigcap_i H_ia$.$\quad\square$

**2.**&nbsp;$\quad$(a) Let $H$ be the cyclic subgroup (of order $2$) of $S_3$
generated by $\begin{pmatrix}
1&2&3\\
2&1&3\\
\end{pmatrix}$. Then no left coset of $H$ (except $H$ itself) is also a right
coset. There exists $a\in S_3$ such that $aH\cap Ha= \{a\}$.
\
&nbsp;$\quad$(b) If $K$ is the cyclic subgroup (of order $3$) of $S_3$
generated by $\begin{pmatrix}
1&2&3\\
2&3&1\\
\end{pmatrix}$, then every left coset of $K$ is also a right coset of $K$.

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$It is easy to show them.$\quad\square$

**3.** The following conditions on a finite group $G$ are equivalent.
\
&nbsp;$\quad$(i) $|G|$ is prime.
\
&nbsp;$\quad$(ii) $G\neq\langle e\rangle$ and $G$ has no proper subgroups.
\
&nbsp;$\quad$(iii) $G\cong Z_p$ for some prime $p$.

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$_Case (i)$\Rightarrow$(ii)._ Let $H$ be a subgroup
of $G$. By Corollary 4.6, the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$.
So if $|G|$ is prime, then $|H|$ is either $|G|$ or $1$; thus $G$ has no
proper subgroups, and also clearly $G\neq\langle e\rangle$.
_Case (ii)$\Rightarrow$(iii)._ If $G\neq\langle e\rangle$ and $G$ has no
proper subgroups, then every element of $G$ but $e$ is a generator of $G$;
thus $G$ is cyclic and $|G|>1$, and so $G\cong Z_p$ for some positive $p>1$.
If $p>1$ is not prime, then $Z_p$ has a proper subgroup;
a contradiction. _Case (iii)$\Rightarrow$(i)._ Clear.$\quad\square$

**4.** (Euler-Fermat) Let $a$ be an integer and $p$ a prime such that
$p\not\mid a$. Then $a^{p-1}\equiv 1$ (mod $p$). [_Hint:_ Consider
$\overline{a}\in Z_p$ and the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of
$Z_p$; see Exercise 1.7.] It follows that $a^p\equiv a$ (mod $p$) for any
integer $a$.

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$Recall that $G=Z_p - \{0\}$ forms a multiplicative
group of order $p-1$. Let $\overline{a}\in G$. By Lagrange's Theorem,
$|\overline{a}|$ divides $p-1$. Therefore, $a^{p-1}\equiv 1$ (mod $p$)
and $a^p\equiv a$ (mod $p$).$\quad\square$

**5.** Prove that there are only two distinct groups of order $4$ (up to
isomorphism), namely $Z_4$ and $Z_2\bigoplus Z_2$. [_Hint:_ By Lagrange's
Theorem 4.6 a group of order $4$ that is not cyclic must consist of an
identity and three elements of order $2$.]

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$Recall that every cyclic group of order $4$ is
isomorphic to $Z_4$. So we assume that $G$ is not cyclic. Then $G$
consists of one element of order $1$, i.e., identity and three elements of
order $2$; otherwise, at least one element of $G - \{e\}$ has order $4$,
and this implies that $G$ is cyclic, a contradiction. If $a,b\in G$, then
$(ab)^2=e$ and $a^2b^2=ee=e$; thus $(ab)^2=a^2b^2$, and so $G$ is
abelian. Let $G=\{e, a, b, c\}$. Since $b^2=e$, $b=b^{-1}$; thus $ab\neq e$,
and since $a\neq e$ and $b\neq e$, $ab\neq a$ and $ab\neq b$, and so $ab=c$.
Since $G$ is abelian, $ba=c$. Similarly, $ac=ca=b$ and $bc=bc=a$.
Define $f:Z_2\bigoplus Z_2\to G$ as follows:
$$
f(0,0) = e,f(1,0) = a,f(0,1) = b,f(1,1) = c.
$$
Now we show that $f$ is a homomorphism.
$$
f((0,0)+(x,y))=f((x,y))=ef((x,y))=f((0,0))f((x,y)),\\
f((0,1)+(0,1))=e=b^2=f((0,1))f((0,1)),\\
f((0,1)+(1,0))=c=ba=f((0,1))f((1,0)),\\
f((0,1)+(1,1))=a=bc=f((0,1))f((1,1)),\\
f((1,1)+(1,1))=e=c^2=f((1,1))f((1,1)),\\
f((1,0)+(1,0))=e=a^2=f((1,0))f((1,0)),\\
f((1,1)+(1,0))=b=ca=f((1,1))f((1,0)).
$$
Since $G$ is abelian, above cases are enough to show that $f$ is a
homomorphism. Since $f$ is bijective, $f$ is a isomorphism; thus
$G\cong Z_2\bigoplus Z_2$. Therefore, there are only two distinct groups
of order 4.$\quad\square$

**6.** Let $H,K$ be subgroups of a group $G$. Then $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$
if and only if $HK=KH$.

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$_Case $\Rightarrow$._ It is easy to show that
if $G$ is a group then $G=\{g^{-1}\mid g\in G\}$. Since $H$ and $K$ are
groups, $HK=\{hk\mid h\in H, k\in K\}=$ $\{h^{-1}k^{-1}\mid h\in H,
k\in K\}$. Since $HK$ is a group, $HK=\{(h^{-1}k^{-1})^{-1}\mid h\in H,
k\in K\}=$ $\{kh\mid h\in H, k\in K\}=KH$.
\
&nbsp;$\quad$_Case $\Leftarrow$._ Clearly, $e\in HK$. Let $x,y\in HK$.
$x=hk$ and $y=h'k'$ for some $h,h'\in H$ and $k,k'\in K$; thus
$xy=hkh'k'$. Since $HK=KH$, $kh'=h''k''$ for some $h''\in H$
and $k''\in K$; thus $xy=hh''k''k'\in HK$. $x^{-1}=k^{-1}h^{-1}$. Similarly,
$k^{-1}h^{-1}=h'''k'''$ for some $h'''\in H$ and $k'''\in K$; thus
$x^{-1}\in HK$. Therefore, $HK$ is a group.$\quad\square$

**7.** Let $G$ be a group of order $p^km$, with $p$ prime and $(p,m) = 1$.
Let $H$ be a subgroup of order $p^k$ and $K$ a subgroup of order $p^d$,
with $0<d<k$ and $K\not\subset H$. Show that $HK$ is not a subgroup of $G$.

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$By Theorem 4.7, $|HK|=|H||K|/|H\cap K|$. Since
$H\cap K\subset K$, $|H\cap K|=p^q$ for some $0<q<d$; thus $|HK|=p^{k+d-q}$.
Since $k+d-q>k$ and $(p,m)=1$, $|HK|$ does not divides $|G|$. Therefore,
$HK$ is not a subgroup of $G$.$\quad\square$

**8.** If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of finite index of a group $G$ such that
$[G:H]$ and $[G:K]$ are relatively prime, then $G=HK$.

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$Notice that $[G:K][K:H\cap K]=$
$[G:H][H:H\cap K]=$ $[G:H\cap K]$. Since $[G:H]$ and $[G:K]$ are
relatively prime, $[G:K]\mid[H:H\cap K]$. By Proposition 4.8,
$[H : H \cap K] \le [G : K]$. Thus $[G:K]=[H:H\cap K]$, and so
$[G:H\cap K]=[G:H][G:K]$. Therefore, also by Proposition 4.8,
$G=HK$.$\quad\square$

**9.** If $H,K$ and $N$ are subgroups of a group $G$ such that $H<N$, then
$HK\cap N=H(K\cap N)$.

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$Notice that $H(K\cap N) = \{hx\mid h\in H,
x\in K\cap N\}=$ $\{hk=hn\mid h\in H, k\in K, n\in N\}=$ $HK \cap HN$.
Since $H<N$ and $e\in H$, $HN=N$. Therefore, $HK\cap N=HK\cap
HN=H(K\cap N)$.$\quad\square$

**10.** Let $H,K,N$ be subgroups of a group $G$ such that $H<K, H\cap N=K\cap
N$, and $HN=KN$. Show that $H=K$.

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$$K\subset KN=HN$. Thus $K\subset HN\cap K$.
By Excercise 9, $HN\cap K=H(K\cap N)=H(H\cap N)=H$. Thus $K\subset H$.
Therefore $K=H$.$\quad\square$

**11.** Let $G$ be a group of order $2n$; then $G$ contains an element of
order $2$. If $n$ is odd and $G$ abelian, there is only one element of order
$2$.

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$By Exercise 1.14, if $G$ is even, then $G$
contains an element of order $2$. Now suppose that $n$ is odd, $G$ is abelian,
and $a,b\in G$ such that $a\neq b$ are of order $2$. Consider $S=\{e, a, b,
ab\}$. It is easy to show that $S$ forms a subgroup of $G$, but since $n$
is odd, $4\not\mid 2n$; a contradiction.$\quad\square$

**12.** If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$, then $[H\vee K:H]\ge[K:
H\cap K]$.

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$By Proposition 4.8, obvious; $H$ and $K$ are
subgroups of $H\vee K$.$\quad\square$

**13.** If $p>q$ are primes, a group of order $pq$ has at most one subgroup of
order $p$. [_Hint:_ Suppose $H,K$ are distinct subgroups of order $p$. Show
$H\cap K=\langle e\rangle$; use Exercise 12 to get a contradiction.]

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$Since $H\cap K$ is a subgroup of $H$ and $p$ is
prime, $H\cap K$ is $\langle e\rangle$ or $H$. Since $H,K$ are distinct,
$H\cap K$ is $\langle e\rangle$. By Exercise 12, $[K: H\cap K]=|K|=p<$
$[H\vee K:H]$; thus $p^2\le|H\vee K|$, and so $|H\vee K|>pq$;
a contradiction.$\quad\square$

**14.** Let $G$ be a group and $a,b\in G$ such that (i) $|a|=4=|b|$; (ii)
$a^2=b^2$; (iii) $ba=a^3b=a^{-1}b$; (iv) $a\neq b$; (v)
$G=\langle a,b\rangle$. Show that $|G|=8$ and $\cong Q_8$. (See Exercise 2.3;
observe that the generators $A,B$ of $Q_8$ also satisfy (i)-(v).)

**_Proof._**&nbsp;$\quad$Consider $S=\{e,a,a^2,a^3,b,ab,a^2b,a^3b\}$. It
is trivial but easy to show that $S$ is the only group satisfying
the properties above.$\quad\square$
