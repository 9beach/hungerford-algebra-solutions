### 4. Cosetsand Counting

**1.** Let $G$ be a group and $\{H\mid i\in I\}$ a family of subgroups. Then
for any $a\in G$, $(\bigcap_i H_i)a=\bigcap_i H_ia$.

**2.**&nbsp;$\quad$(a) Let $H$ be the cyclic subgroup (of order $2$) of $S_3$ generated by
$\begin{pmatrix}
1&2&3\\
2&1&3\\
\end{pmatrix}$. Then no left coset of $H$ (except $H$ itself) is also a right
coset. There exists $a\in S_3$ such that $aH\cap Ha= \{a\}$.
\
&nbsp;$\quad$(b) If $K$ is the cyclic subgroup (of order $3$) of $S_3$
generated by $\begin{pmatrix}
1&2&3\\
2&3&1\\
\end{pmatrix}$, then every left coset of $K$ is also a right coset of $K$.

**3.** The following conditions on a finite group $G$ are equivalent.
\
&nbsp;$\quad$(i) $|G|$ is prime.
\
&nbsp;$\quad$(ii) $G\neq\langle e\rangle$ and $G$ has no proper subgroups.
\
&nbsp;$\quad$(iii) $G\cong Z_p$ for some prime $p$.

**4.** (Euler-Fermat) Let $a$ be an integer and $p$ a prime such that
$p\not\mid a$. Then $a^{p-1}\equiv 1$ (mod $p$). [_Hint:_ Consider
$\overline{a}\in Z_p$ and the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of
$Z_p$; see Exercise 1.7.] It follows that $a^p\equiv a$ (mod $p$) for any
integer $a$.

**5.** Prove that there are only two distinct groups of order $4$ (up to
isomorphism), namely $Z_4$ and $Z_2\bigoplus Z_2$. [_Hint:_ By Lagrange's
Theorem 4.6 a group of order $4$ that is not cyclic must consist of an identity
and three elements of order $2$.]

**6.** Let $H,K$ be subgroups of a group $G$. Then $HK$ is a subgroup of $G$
if and only if $HK=KH$.

**7.** Let $G$ be a group of order $p^km$, with $p$ prime and $(p,m) = 1$.
Let $H$ be a subgroup of order $p^k$ and $K$ a subgroup of order $p^d$,
with $O<d<k$ and $K\not\subset H$. Show that $HK$ is not a subgroup of $G$.

**8.** If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of finite index of a group $G$ such that
$[G:H]$ and $[G:K]$ are relatively prime, then $G=HK$.

**9.** If $H,K$ and $N$ are subgroups of a group $G$ such that $H<N$, then
$HK\cap N=H(K\cap N)$.

**10.** Let $H,K,N$ be subgroups of a group $G$ such that $H<K, H\cap N=K\cap
N$, and $HN=KN$. Show that $H=K$.

**11.** Let $G$ be a group of order $2n$; then $G$ contains an element of
order $2$. If $n$ is odd and $G$ abelian, there is only one element of order
$2$.

**12.** If $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$, then $[H\vee K:H]\ge[K:
H\cap K]$.

**13.** If $p>q$ are primes, a group of order $pq$ has at most one subgroup of
order $p$. [_Hint:_ Suppose $H,K$ are distinct subgroups of order $p$. Show
$H\cap K=\langle e\rangle$; use Exercise 12 to get a contradiction.]

**14.** Let $G$ be a group and $a,b\in G$ such that (i) $|a|=4=|b|$; (ii)
$a^2=b^2$; (iii) $ba=a^3b=a^{-1}b$; (iv) $a\neq b$; (v) $G=\langle a,b\rangle$.
Show that $|G|=8$ and $\cong Q_8$. (See Exercise 2.3; observe that the
generators $A,B$ of $Q_8$ also satisfy (i)-(v).)
