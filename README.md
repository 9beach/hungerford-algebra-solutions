# A solutions manual for Algebra by Thomas W. Hungerford
In December 2017, for no special reason I started studying mathematics and
writing a solutions manual for
[Algebra by Thomas W. Hungerford](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Graduate-Texts-Mathematics-v/dp/0387905189).

_GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/9beach/hungerford-algebra-solutions),
HTML versions [here](https://rawgit.com/9beach/hungerford-algebra-solutions/master/README.html),
and PDF version [here](https://github.com/9beach/hungerford-algebra-solutions/releases)._
